## Servlet Attributes Demo Repository
Welcome to the Servlet Attributes Demo repository! This repository contains a Java web application that demonstrates how to use attributes in servlets and share these attributes between different servlets. This demo provides a comprehensive understanding of servlet attributes and their usage in a web application.

## Key Concepts Covered
## Servlet Attributes
Attributes in servlets are objects that can be set, retrieved, and removed from various scopes (request, session, application). They are used to share information between different components of a web application.

## Request Attributes
Purpose: Used to pass data between servlets or JSPs during a single request.
Scope: Exist only for the duration of the request.
Use Case: Commonly used for passing data from one servlet to another when forwarding a request.
## Session Attributes
Purpose: Used to maintain state for a particular user session.
Scope: Persist across multiple requests from the same user.
Use Case: Often used for storing user-specific data, such as login information or shopping cart contents, that needs to be accessed across multiple interactions with the web application.
## Application Attributes
Purpose: Shared across the entire web application.
Scope: Accessible by any servlet or JSP within the application.
Use Case: Typically used for storing global data, such as application-wide settings or resources that need to be accessed by multiple components.
## RequestDispatcher Interface
The RequestDispatcher interface is used to forward a request from one servlet to another resource (such as another servlet or a JSP) or to include content from another resource in the response.

Forwarding: Allows one servlet to delegate the processing of a request to another servlet or JSP. This is often used when a servlet handles initial processing and then forwards to a JSP for rendering the response.
Including: Allows one servlet to include the content of another resource in its response. This can be useful for modularizing response generation by including common components, like headers or footers, from other resources.
Project Structure
The project structure includes the following key components:

## Conclusion
This demo application provides a practical example to help you understand and utilize servlet attributes and the RequestDispatcher interface in Java web applications. By exploring this repository, you will gain insights into how to efficiently share data between servlets and manage different scopes of attributes.
